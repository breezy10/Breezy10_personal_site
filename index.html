								Keeping current and always acquiring new skills are essential.</p>
								<h3>Cisco (CCNA/CCNP Enterprise</h3>
								<p>As a Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) I possess the ability to design, implement, configure and troubleshoot any complex enterprise networks. 
									I work in sync with specialists on various advanced technology domains like security, voice, wireless and much more.</p>
								<h3>BCom - Information Technolog</h3>
								<p>The BCom in IT degree helps a lot in the IT sector.  It does so from a business perspective looking at information technologies and the use of information in business. 
									The focus is on information, putting the relevance and value of information systems into perspective.</p>
								<h3>Cert Software Dev (Data Engineering)</h3>
								<p>Despite not being complete.
									In my current role in Network Automation on Cisco DevNet Platforms, I am already utilising this competency. 
									It allows me to demonstrate expertise in the design and development of applications utilising Cisco APIs and 
									platforms, as well as the management and deployment of applications on Cisco infrastructure.</p>
